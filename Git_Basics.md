**To satrt with Git** first you need to create a account on GitHub or Bitbucket.org

After creating account create a **Repository**
---

### Cloning a Repository

`$ git clone <repositary url>`

+ repository url = https://github.com/codewithnaveen/Learn-Git.git
+ copying the remote repository to local machine
+ this will get the repository in a new folder,
+ and the same will be same as repository name
+ you will do this only once (first time)
---

**You will go to the local repository folder in your machine make changes in the files & folders then you need to push these changes to the remote server**

`git add .`

+ adding our changes to the local respository
---

`git commit -m "commit message"`

+ we are writing those changes to the local repository
+ so that they can be tracked
---

`git push origin master`

+ now we want the local changes to be saved in the remote/origin server
+ we will push those changes to remote server in master branch
---

`git pull origin master`

+ to get the latest changes from the remote repository
